# GT-MP-Animator-Resource

Hi everyone,

This Animator resource lets you play all animations avaliable in this list:
https://wiki.gt-mp.net/index.php?title=Animations

It's a very simple but useful script. Searching through the animations list is like looking for needle in the haystack, considering about 2/5 of all anims cannot be applied to ped and 1/2 of those you wouldn't really find use for. It's a great solution if you don't want to install any mods to view anims. Just include the file and preview! Save included.
There are 12,365 animations to play. Some of anims do not work on player as they are intended to be used on props, vehicles, weapons etc.
You can also experience a few seconds delay on some animations, but none of them causes crashes.
After launching the Animator a drawText will appear in bottom-right corner of the screen, showing you which animation you are viewing including ID, animation group and name.

How to install:
- UnZip the file and move the animator folder to your server resources folder.
- Include animator resource in resource of your choice, or include it in settings.xml of your server.

How to use:
- Type /animator to launch or close the animator.
- Type /animator help for in-game help.
- Type /animator skip [number] to skip to animation id.
- Type /animator save [savename] to save the animation. ( saves in server root folder in Saved_Animations.txt. )
- Type /animator stop to stop currently playing animation.
- Use LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to cycle through animations.
- Use UP and DOWN arrow keys to cycle through 100 animations at once.

Notes:
- All animations are looped.
